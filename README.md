## Lawrence Hunt
*Junior Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in Design and Advertising*

Two things excite me more than anything: looking for creative solutions to problems, and creating captivating digital experiences.

For 5 years I've worked in the creative departments of some top London ad agencies, while freelancing as a front end designer/developer for the Institute of Psychoanalysis.
Now after an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp, I've matured into a confident full stack junior developer, capable of writing clean, test-driven code that follows SOLID principles.

I get most excited about projects where I can work in the full stack, and I love to experiment with new technologies - particularly those built on JavaScript.
In my final 2 weeks at Makers Academy I learned Meteor.js and used it to build an app that turns saving into a multiplayer game between friends.

I track my weekly progress as a developer on my blog [here](https://medium.com/@lawrencehunt).

I'm looking for a Junior Full Stack role in an agile environment where my creative experience will be valued, and I can continue to learn as quickly as I have been.
