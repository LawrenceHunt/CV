## Lawrence Hunt

I'm a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in Design and Advertising.
Two things excite me above all else: looking for creative solutions to big problems, and building digital experiences that captivate.

For 5 years I've worked in the creative departments of some top London ad agencies, while also freelancing as a front end designer/developer for the Institute of Psychoanalysis.
Now after an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp, I've matured into a confident full stack junior developer, capable of writing clean, test-driven code that follows SOLID principles.

I feel most energised by team projects where I can work in the full stack, and I love to teach myself new technologies - particularly those built on JavaScript.
In my final 2 weeks at Makers Academy I taught myself Meteor.js and used it to build an idea I'd had while working on an ad campaign for a bank: an app that turns saving for a mortgage into a social game between friends.

I also blog my weekly progress as a developer [here](https://medium.com/@lawrencehunt)!

###What I'm after

I'm looking for a Junior Full Stack role in an agile environment where my creative experience will be valued, and where I can continue to learn as quickly as I have been.

## <a name="skills"> What I can offer </a>

#### A Curious Mind

I love to pick up new things and try to spot the underlying patterns that help you master the basics - whether it's a new language, framework or obscure strategy game.
I taught msyelf Meteor.js for my final project at Makers Academy, and I'm currently trying my hand at Unity.

#### An Eye for Design and User Experience

As an Art Director I've learned how to create compelling visual narratives communicate a message emotively.

- I have learned how to work with writers, strategists, illustrators and senior developers.
- I can present ideas clearly with well-designed wireframes and slide decks.
- I also helped completely overhaul the visual identity of a major psychoanalytical organisation, including its [website](https://www.psychoanalysis.org.uk)

### Enthusiastic Problem Solver

Whether troubleshooting code or generating new ideas, I'm good at asking the right questions to find an answer. I'm equally happy brainstorming alone or as a member of a lively team.

- I collaborated on a large number of commercial and content pieces, from initial concepting to production.
  Like [this one](https://vimeo.com/132842374). And [this one](http://huntzachy.com/work/subway/).
- I won an industry award for a speculative concept to 'gamify' saving between friends - see below.
