**I'm a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in Design and Advertising.**
**Two things excite me above all else: looking for creative solutions to big problems, and building captivating digital experiences.**

For 5 years I've worked in the creative departments of some top London ad agencies, while also freelancing as a front end designer/developer for the Institute of Psychoanalysis.
Now after an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://employers.makersacademy.com/), I've matured into a confident full stack junior developer, capable of writing clean, test-driven code that follows SOLID principles.

I feel most energised by team projects where I can work in the full stack, and I'm comfortable picking up new technologies quickly.
In my final 2 weeks at Makers Academy I taught myself Meteor.js and used it to build an app to help young people save for a house.

I also blog weekly about my progress as a developer [here](https://medium.com/@lawrencehunt).

I'm looking for a Junior role in an agile environment where my creative experience will be valued, and where I can continue to learn as quickly as I have been.

## <a name="skills"> What I can offer </a>

### Curiosity

I love picking up a new tool and figuring out how to use it - whether it's a new language, framework or software package.
I taught msyelf Meteor.js for my final project at Makers Academy, and I'm currently working on a 3D game in Unity.

### An Eye for Design and UX

As an Art Director I've learned how to weave pictures and words into compelling narratives.

- I've learned how to work with writers, strategists, illustrators and senior developers.
- I can confidently put together wireframes and presentations.
- I helped completely overhaul the visual identity of a major psychoanalytical organisation, including its [website](https://www.psychoanalysis.org.uk)

### Problem Solver

Whether troubleshooting code or coming up with new projects to work on, I'm good at asking the right questions and coming up with the right strategies to tackle a specific problem.
I'm happy brainstorming alone or as a member of a lively team.

- In my advertising job I worked on a large number of content pieces on all platforms, seeing them through from initial concepting stage to production.
  Like [this one](https://vimeo.com/132842374). And [this one](http://huntzachy.com/work/subway/).
- I won an industry award for a speculative concept to 'gamify' saving between friends - see below.

## <a name="awards"> Awards </a>

### Graphite Pencil, D&AD New Blood 2015 (International Creative Industry Awards)
Nationwide were looking for ways to become more relevant to the digital generation.
I won an award for this idea to gamify saving for a house between groups of friends.
At Makers Academy I then pitched the idea to my classmates and we developed it as a proof of concept!
