## Lawrence Hunt
*Former Advertising Creative looking for a new challenge as a Jr Full-Stack Developer*

For five years I worked in the creative departments of various ad agencies, first as a copywriter and then as an Art Director.
After graduating from Europe's top coding bootcamp, I have fallen for the craftsmanship and rigour that a programming career offers.
I now want to apply my creative experience and problem solving skills to developing great online experiences.

Ambitious and team-driven, I am confident in my ability to contribute from day one and pick up any new technology quickly.
I am looking for a Junior Full Stack role in an agile environment where my creative experience will be valued, and I can continue to learn as quickly as I have been.

#### Writing & Creative Concepting

Over five years in ad agencies in London and in Europe, I have proven my ability to break a problem down and solve it with both logical and lateral thinking.
